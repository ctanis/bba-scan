A blackboard course archive is a nasty hive of inter-related xml.  I
just wanted to extract gradebook information to generate a student
portfolio for accreditation purposes.  I'm putting it here in case
there is a value to others.

I'm in the process of moving to an OO perl module interface (how
quaint).  Perhaps you have a better idea?
